# Version

Grafana Loki uses Semantic Versioning. The next version can be determined by looking at the current version and incrementing it.

## `VERSION`

To determine the `VERSION` for a Stable Release or Patch Release, use the Semantic Version `vX.Y.Z`

- Examples
  - For example, `v2.9.0` is the Stable Release `VERSION` for the `v2.9.0` release.
  - For example, `v2.9.1` is the first Patch Release `VERSION` for the `v2.9.0` release.

## `VERSION_PREFIX`

To determine the `VERSION_PREFIX`, use only the `MAJOR` and `MINOR` version `vX.Y`.

- Examples
  - `v2.9`
